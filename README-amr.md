Before we go too far, we should get our fork/upstream repos set up.

Needed to install some additional development libraries using apt:

- libxcb-xkb-dev
- libxcb-xinerama0-dev
- libxcb-randr0-dev
- libev-dev
- libxcb-image0-dev
- libxcb-util0-dev
- libxcb-xrm-dev
- libxkbcommon-x11-dev
- libpam0g-dev

TODO

- Display custom text below the typing sensor, but only when it's in effect.
- As a bonus, make any background or bg image only appear when the sensor
  appears.
